<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2024)</h1>


<h2>Wed 14 Aug</h2>

<p>Vacation time had arrived, but there was still lots to do before I
could take off.

<p>I had signed up for one of the Spotted Lanternfly update webinars from
MDAR (MA Dept of Agricultural Resources).  Not only hadn't I had an update
on the spotted lanternfly status in a while, it is also worth one
pesticide training hour credit.  I only need six of those in every three
year span, but I was a bit behind.

<p>There are now a number of known breeding populations of the lanternfly
in MA.  They showed a map, and the closest to Groton that was highlighted
was Ayer.  I am not sure if that meant they know of a breeding population
there, or whether there was only a confirmed sighting.  Either way, it's
bad.  They haven't been sighted in Groton yet, but they are probably
already here.

<p>By the time I got most things gathered and the car arranged for a trip,
it was mid afternoon.  I decided to stay home that day, and leave in the
morning.


<h2>Thu 15 Aug</h2>

<p>Things were mostly ready from the day before.  I got up leasurely, but
still left around 8:00.  My first destination was the school department in
Plattsburgh NY to see what I can find about Roy (my grandfather) since he
graduated from high school there.

<p>It's a long car ride from Groton to Plattsburgh, so I stopped to
stretch my legs in Keene NH and Rutland VT, plus at any rest area I bumped
into.

<p>I finally got to the Plattsburgh School Dept main office around 15:30.
There was one person at the front desk, but the place was otherwise
deserted.  I explained that I was looking for a yearbook and any other
student records they might have from around 1889.  She said I needed to
come back in the morning to talk to someone else that isn't in right now.

<p>I needed a place to plunk down my tent for the night that wasn't too
far from Plattsburgh.  I found Ausable Point State Park on Lake Champlain
just south of Plattsburgh that had a campground.

<p>When I got there, they said yes they had open spots, but no, I couldn't
just walk in and get one.  That can only be done by making a reservation
on-line, even if you show up in person.  Argh.  I had to pull over, get
out the laptop, sign up with the app that NY uses, and make the
reservation.  On top of all that, there was a $7.25 charge for the
"convenience" of making the reservation on line. That seems like quite a
lot to the app company for what is a totally automated process.  NY
doesn't care.  It makes it easy on their end.  Good thing there was
cell coverage there so that my laptop could connect to the internet.

<p>That loop of the campground looked like it was built right on a
wetland.  The loop road and each campsite was surrounded by swamp.  It was
probably built a while ago.  That wouldn't be allowed today, at least in
MA, and probably NY too.

        of the site at left, right, and in the back.</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>Now that I knew NY had a state-wide system that requires on-line
registrations, I made a reservation for Friday night at a campground in
the Adirondacks not too far from Plattsburgh.  I figured I could be in
Plattsburgh until closing time on Friday, and didn't want to drive too far
to where I'd stay the night.


<h2>Fri 16 Aug</h2>

<p>I got to the school department office at 8:30.  They open at 8:00, but
I didn't want try asking for a favor immediately when they got in.

<p>I met with the assistant to the superintendent.  She called some place
that said they didn't have records going that far back.  She then said
she'd talk to the librarian and someone at the high school, and call me in
the afternoon.  I know she got my cell phone number correct, because she
called me a short time later to tell me that the Suny Plattsburgh library
was supposed to have duplicate copies of school department records.

<p>I headed off to find the Suny Plattsburgh library, which turned out to
be only a short distance down the road from the school department office.
Suny Plattsburgh has lots of parking lots, but they are all reserved for
something.  I found one lot that was largely empty.  I figured between
that and it being summer, they might not care.

<p>In the process of looking around for the library, I noticed four EV
charging stations in another lot.  Only one of them was in use, so I moved
the car there.

<p>I had previously checked with the Chargepoint app to see if there were
any free charging stations around, but there were none in the greater
Plattsburgh area.  It was a Chargepoint charger, which I enabled with my
Chargepoint card.  After hooking up the car, I checked the app again.  No,
it really wasn't listed.  Apparently there are secret charging stations.

<p>Eventually I found the library, which ended up being pretty close to
the car.  The people at the main desk let me talk via phone to someone on
the "bottom floor".  No, I don't know why I couldn't just go down there
and talk to her directly.  She didn't think they had public school
department records that far back, but wanted me to send her email with the
details so that she could look around more leasurely.  I went back to the
car and did that.

<p>For some reason, my car only charges at half the 6.6 kW rate most
chargers can do.  I noticed that before.  That happened two years ago too,
and Chevy supposedly fixed something.  I don't know if they didn't really
fix it, or the problem is back.  In any case, it took almost five hours
for my car to fully charge. I had to stick around to get the phone call
from the assistant to the superintendent, but it never came.  I didn't get
any reply to my email to the Suny librarian either.

<p>The charging station was in front of the art museum, in full sun.  Once
the car was fully charged, I went to a city park for a while where there
was some shade.  I didn't want to head to where I would spend the night
right away because I suspected there might not be any cell coverage, and I
needed to deal with some Jowa issues over email.  I also wanted to stay
where I could receive a phone call from the school department.

<p>At 17:00 I headed over to the Taylor Pond Campground where I had made a
reservation the previous evening.  The only open spot was the one right in
the middle of the campground loop.

    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>It's 19:20 now, and reasonably quiet.  Maybe it won't be too bad
tonight. Tomorrow I'll explore the Adirondacks.

<p>I wrote that too soon.  Shortly after I wrote the above, there was a
really loud bang.  It sounded like one of those old muskets used for
historical re-enactments going off, except louder since it wasn't
immediately near me.  The ranger showed up on his motorized cart, and
everyone pointed him in the direction the sound came from.  Some yahoos
had set off fireworks.  I could hear the ranger yelling at them and
telling them to leave.  He then followed them out of the campground on his
cart.

<p>It wasn't too bad after that, considering the usual late-comers with
car headlights, banging doors, talking loudly, and the like.


<h2>Sat 17 Aug</h2>

<p>When I talked to Amy for her birthday back in April, I mentioned the
possibility of going to Plattsburgh to see what I could find about Roy.
She said to call when the plans were more firm and that I could visit them
in Cicero.  I had called Amy from the car on Thursday shortly after
leaving, and we arranged that I would be at her house on Sunday at 12:00.
Today I wanted to poke around the Adirondacks a bit, but end up not too
far from Amy's house for the night.  I was in the northeastern part of the
Adirondacks, and her house in Cicero (outside of Syracuse) is west and
south of the Adirondacks.

<p>I started heading southwest and stopped in Tupper Lake because I
expected there would be cell coverage so that I could make a reservation
for camp tonight.  Being Saturday, I knew there weren't going to be a lot
of choices.  After checking several full campgrounds, I found a spot in
Delta Lake State Park just north of Rome.  It's less than an hour from
there to Amy's house.  The site was meant for RVs since it came with an
electrical hookup.  At least I could use the electricity to charge my car
during the night.

<p>While on-line, I also noticed there were several free charging stations
in Tupper Lake.  It had started raining, so I might as well hang out there
and let the car charge.  When the car was full, I headed off to Delta
Lake.  It rained most of the time, but stopped just as I got there.

  </table>


<h2>Sun 18 Aug</h2>

<p>The car was fully charged by morning.  I headed off to Amy's house,
knowing I had a few extra hours.  I found a nice city park on Oneida Lake
to hang out at for a while.  It was raining on and off again, but there
was time to walk along the lake and watch the dogs (and owners) frolick
around the dog park that was there.

<p>I got to Amy's house during a gap in the rain, so we took a few
pictures.  It's a nice place with tranquil surroundings.

<p>We called Elden to let him know I was at Amy's.  Elden and Linda came
by later for dinner.  Amy made a delicious shepherd's pie.  It was great
getting to see everyone again and catch up on things.  The last time I was
in the area was for Amy's wedding almost three years ago.  I stayed the
night in Amy's guest bedroom.
