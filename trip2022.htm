<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2022)</h1>


<h2>Thu 28 Jul</h2>

<p>Actually leaving Groton took a while.  There were more things to do,
and they took longer than I expected.

<p>I got to Ari's house by 15:00.  Jora barked at first, but then seemed
to remember me.  When I sat down on the couch, he immediately jumped on my
lap and started to lick my face.  Fortunately I had put my glasses aside,
else they would have ended up covered in doggy slobber.

<p>We picked up Leah from day care, and took a look thru the new house in
Bristol along the way.  Leah liked the swing at the little park down the
street from the daycare place.  It took a few tries, but I eventually
found something that made her laugh on the swing.

<p>Later when Nicole came home (it was the last day of her job at
Ratheon), we walked around the block with Leah in the stroller.  Leah saw
the stroller in the garage and seemed to want to go out in it.

<p>Before the sun went down, we took a group picture:

<h2>Fri 29 Jul</h2>

<p>I left Ari's house around 7:00 and headed towards Danbury CT.  There
aren't any route choices to make until then.

<p>You'd think there would be an interstate, or at least some divided
highway between Providence and Hartford, but no!

<p>The plan is to stop in Danbury to look at maps and figure out where to
spend the night.  The first destination is Shenandoah, but that's too far
to arrive at a decent time today.  That's especially true on a Friday
since camp sites might fill up by late afternoon.  A state park in PA
southeast of Scranton seems about right.

<p>I'm not low on gas, but am heading to more rural areas where it might
cost more than Danbury, and it's convenient here.  $4.24/gal is as good
as I'd seen anywhere recently.

<p>I pulled up to the pump and reached for my wallet.  It wasn't there. Oh
crap!  I looked around under the seat and behind the seat, but nothing.
Did I leave it at Ari's?  No, I never took it out of the car.  Then I got
that sinking feeling I left it on the windowsill in Groton.  Leslie is at
the music festival, so can't check.  Now what?  Should I call Ari in case
I did leave it there somehow?  Do I really have to go back to Groton? This
sucks!

<p>OK, at least stop blocking the gas pump, pull over to a parking spot
and get over it.  The wallet is wherever it is.  You can't fix that.  The
last time I used it was yesterday morning to buy gas in Groton.  That
means it should be in the car.  Let's make really sure it's not here
before wasting a whole day going back to Groton, and then maybe not
finding it there anyway.

<p>I've got the flashlight and am ready to toss the whole car to either
find the wallet or make sure it's really not here.  The first place to
look is under the seat.  It's dark there, and maybe I missed it before.
There it is!  Phew!!

<p>I made it to the state park in PA by 15:00.  It turns out there were
lots of empty campsites still.  Of course this isn't a major attraction.
Here is my camp site with the little tent in the back at left:

    </tbody>
  </table>


<h2>Sat 30 Jul</h2>

<p>I got up and pretty much drove straight to Front Royal, other than
stopping at rest areas to stretch the legs.  I filled up the tank in Front
Royal (only $3.70/gal) and headed straight to Skyline Drive.  The old-fart
pass got me into the park for free.  At the entrance, there were four
campgrounds listed, with the middle two already full.  That meant heading
straight for the first campground and unfortunately not stopping at the
many scenic turnouts along the way.  Fortunately there were still sites
left when I got there, and even in the no-generators section.

<p>It's amazing how much stuff people take with them to go camping.  When
we did this growing up, most people had a car, a tent, and not much else.
Nowadays most campsites have multiple tents, an awning, and and lots of
junk all around.  Sometimes there are tents plus campers or trailers.
These people go to have an experience in the wild, but then try to make
the wild like home. What's the point!?

<p>After claiming a spot and setting up camp, I went back to a few of the
nearby scenic vistas.

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Hogback Mt Overlook</i>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>There was a large group of people here talking in a language I
couldn't even guess what it was.  It turns out they were from Kurdistan.
They were surprised that a random person knew where that was.  They had me
take a few group pictures for them, then took a picture of me with part of
the group.  I can just imagine how that will be shown back home.  <i>...
and look, here is one of the natives ...</i>

  </table>


<h2>Sun 31 Jul</h2>

<p>It's drizzeling off and on today.  I'm slowly making my way south on
Skyline Drive, stopping at all the overlooks on the way.  The speed limit
is only 35 MPH, but I usually go 30 unless there is someone behind me.

<p>There is actually cell coverage at the Stony Man overlook.  It's now a
solid rain, so I'm checking email and updating this web page.

<p>A few hours later, it's still raining most of the time, but it's also
gotten windy and foggy.  I think the ridge top is basically in the clouds.
I was able to get a camping spot at Big Meadows and set up the tent during
a lull in the rain.

<p>There's not much to do at the campsite, especially in the rain, so I
went down the road a short ways to the Tanners Ridge overlook.  Supposedly there
is a nice view here.  I'll have to take their word for it.

<p><table class="fixed-wide">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="9006.jpg" width=70%></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Grand view from Tanners Ridge Overlook</i>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>It's 62&deg;F here with wind blowing west across the ridge.
Fortunately it's reasonably comfortable in the car.  With the car pointed
south I can open the passenger side window.  The wind keeps the rain from
coming in on that side.  There is also cell service here, probably from
the valley below.


<h2>Mon 1 Aug</h2>

<p>The clouds have lifted and it's not raining anymore.  There really are
some nice views from Skyline Drive after all.

<p><table class="fixed-wide">

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="9007.jpg" width=70%></a>

    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>Today I'm just slowly making my way south, looking at the scenery along
the way.  I left Shenandoah National Park, and continued south on the Blue
Ridge Parkway.  It's 469 miles long and connects Shenandoah NP to the
Great Smokey Mountains NP.

<p>Tonight I'm stopping at the Peaks of Otter campground so that I can
hike up one of the nearby mountains tomorrow.


<h2>Tue 2 Aug</h2>

<p>I started the morning hiking up Sharp Top Mountain.  It was quite
windy, but there were some great views from the top.

<p>Originally, Sharp Top Mountain was thought to be the highest point in
Virginia.  A stone from there was put in the Washington Monument with an
inscription to that effect.  However, it was later found that a few other
peaks were a little higher, including Flat Top Mountain just a couple of
miles north.

<p>The parkway goes right by Roanoke, so I stopped there to get more food
and fill up the tank.  Folks down here don't believe in masks much.  I saw
only three or four other shoppers and staff in Walmart wearing masks. It's
much worse here than in Market Basket in Littleton.

<p>I'm staying the night at the Rocky Knob campground.  The old-fart pass
is paying its way.  Entrance to Shenandoah was free, and one night at a
campground is $10, instead of $20 for the unwashed masses.


<h2>Wed 3 Aug</h2>

<p>Today was mostly a traveling day.  I kept on going south on the Blue
Ridge Parkway.

<p>It's Wednesday, so by tomorrow night I want to be in Smokey Mountains
NP, to avoid filled-up campgrounds.  That means tonight is my last night
on the Blue Ridge Parkway. I had originally planned to get past Asheville
today, but then I noticed that Mt Mitchell, the highest point east of the
Missisippi, is right off the parkway.  It's too late to do it today, so
I'm camping at Crabtree Falls, just a little north of there.  Hopefully
the weather cooperates, and I can hike up Mt Mitchell tomorrow morning.

<h2>Thu 4 Aug</h2>

<p>I hiked up Mt Mitchell this morning.  There is a road to the top, but I
parked at a ranger station about 2 miles from the top and walked up and
down the road.  There is a raised obervation deck at the top with nice
views all around.

<p>After Mt Mitchell I stopped in Asheville to gas up and get more food
since I was there anyway.  Mask usage is even worse here than it was in
Roanoke.

<p>I tried out a free car charging station in Asheville.  It was supposed
to be 6.6 kW, but was charging much more slowly than that.  The car should
have been full after about 2 hours, but it would have taken much longer.
I checked email and did a few other tasks while charging.  In the end, I
think I got an extra 15 miles out of it.

<p>Today I finally got to the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.  Being
a Thursday, I thought it would be easy to pick a camp site and stay there
for the next week or so.  However, everything is on a reservation system
here. You can only show up and use sites that haven't been reserved on
that day.  I grabbed the first site I could get, then went back down the
road to the visitor center where there was coverage for my cell modem, and
booked reservations thru next weekend.

<p>There was quite a spectacle at the visitor center, even though it was
already closed for the day.  Apparently elk were wiped out in this area,
then re-introduced in 2001.  The herd has grown ever since, and is up to
250 individuals now.  These elk have never been hunted, by humans or
predators.  As a result, they treat humans as don't-cares, and get quite
close.  The elk wander to the meadow around the visitor center, and
sometimes its lawn, every evening.  There are volunteers with yellow vests
to keep the visitors from walking right up to the elk and getting charged,
which apparently happened last year.  The people were the real spectacle!

<h2>Fri 5 Aug</h2>

<p>I had only booked the campsite for one night, expeting to move further
into the park the next day.  However, all sites are on a reservation
system.  Yesterday evening I was only able to book a site starting
tomorrow night, so need to extend my stay here for one night.

<p>The site I was in had already been reserved by someone else for
tonight.  I ended up moving 3 sites down.  Fortunately, my little tent is
easy to tear down and set up.  I don't really tear it down.  I just fold
it up a little with air mattress and sleeping bag still in it, then cram
the result in the trunk.

<p>Later I found a lake and went swimming.  The water was quite warm.


<h2>Sat 6 Aug</h2>

<p>I woke to a strange crackling sound at 2:45.  My first thought was that
a bear was shredding someone's cooler.  Then it happened again a minute
later, this time longer.  While I was contemplating what that was, it
happened again, even longer and louder.  Now it was clear that a tree had
fallen.

<p>The downed tree was only a few campsites away, maybe 100 meters from my
tent.  It had fallen across the road into another campsite, barely missing
a van with people in it.

<p>A chain saw started working at 7:30, shortly after it was light.  By
the time I took pictures only 10 minutes later, the tree had already been
de-limbed.  By 8:00 it was fully cleared.

<p><table class="fixed-wide">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="9022.jpg" width=70%></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Tree that fell onto campsite in the night.</i>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>Yes folks, low probability events do happen.  A few feet over and
someone would likely have been killed.  I guess the tree was leaning, but
it wasn't rotted, and there was no wind that triggered the fall.  The
chance of getting squished by a falling tree while sleeping in a
maintained campground in calm conditions is far less than many other risks
we take without even thinking about them, but it still <i>can</i> happen.

<p>It was my last day at the Smokemont campground, so I pulled up the tent
and left soon after taking the picture.

<p>I'm going to stay a while on the west side of the park.  The road
across the park goes near Clingmans Dome, slightly higher than Mt
Washington.  There is a road to nearly the top.  I wanted to hike a bit, so
I left the car at a turnout a couple of miles short of the top.

<p>There is a visitor center and large parking lot at the end of the road.
From there it's another &frac12; mile on a paved trail to get to the top.
That gets you to an observation tower with views all around above the tree
tops.
