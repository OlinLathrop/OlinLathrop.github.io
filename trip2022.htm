<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2022)</h1>


<h2>Thu 28 Jul</h2>

<p>Actually leaving Groton took a while.  There were more things to do,
and they took longer than I expected.

<p>I got to Ari's house by 15:00.  Jora barked at first, but then seemed
to remember me.  When I sat down on the couch, he immediately jumped on my
lap and started to lick my face.  Fortunately I had put my glasses aside,
else they would have ended up covered in doggy slobber.

<p>We picked up Leah from day care, and took a look thru the new house in
Bristol along the way.  Leah liked the swing at the little park down the
street from the daycare place.  It took a few tries, but I eventually
found something that made her laugh on the swing.

<p>Later when Nicole came home (it was the last day of her job at
Ratheon), we walked around the block with Leah in the stroller.  Leah saw
the stroller in the garage and seemed to want to go out in it.

<p>Before the sun went down, we took a group picture:

    </tbody>
  </table>


<h2>Fri 29 Jul</h2>

<p>I left Ari's house around 7:00 and headed towards Danbury CT.  There
aren't any route choices to make until then.

<p>You'd think there would be an interstate, or at least some divided
highway between Providence and Hartford, but no!

<p>The plan is to stop in Danbury to look at maps and figure out where to
spend the night.  The first destination is Shenandoah, but that's too far
to arrive at a decent time today.  That's especially true on a Friday
since camp sites might fill up by late afternoon.  A state park in PA
southeast of Scranton seems about right.

<p>I'm not low on gas, but am heading to more rural areas where it might
cost more than Danbury, and it's convenient here.  $4.24/gal is as good
as I'd seen anywhere recently.

<p>I pulled up to the pump and reached for my wallet.  It wasn't there. Oh
crap!  I looked around under the seat and behind the seat, but nothing.
Did I leave it at Ari's?  No, I never took it out of the car.  Then I got
that sinking feeling I left it on the windowsill in Groton.  Leslie is at
the music festival, so can't check.  Now what?  Should I call Ari in case
I did leave it there somehow?  Do I really have to go back to Groton? This
sucks!

<p>OK, at least stop blocking the gas pump, pull over to a parking spot
and get over it.  The wallet is wherever it is.  You can't fix that.  The
last time I used it was yesterday morning to buy gas in Groton.  That
means it should be in the car.  Let's make really sure it's not here
before wasting a whole day going back to Groton, and then maybe not
finding it there anyway.

<p>I've got the flashlight and am ready to toss the whole car to either
find the wallet or make sure it's really not here.  The first place to
look is under the seat.  It's dark there, and maybe I missed it before.
There it is!  Phew!!

<p>I made it to the state park in PA by 15:00.  It turns out there were
lots of empty campsites still.  Of course this isn't a major attraction.
Here is my camp site with the little tent in the back at left:

    </tbody>
  </table>


<h2>Sat 30 Jul</h2>

<p>I got up and pretty much drove straight to Front Royal, other than
stopping at rest areas to stretch the legs.  I filled up the tank in Front
Royal (only $3.70/gal) and headed straight to Skyline Drive.  The old-fart
pass got me into the park for free.  At the entrance, there were four
campgrounds listed, with the middle two already full.  That meant heading
straight for the first campground and unfortunately not stopping at the
many scenic turnouts along the way.  Fortunately there were still sites
left when I got there, and even in the no-generators section.

<p>It's amazing how much stuff people take with them to go camping.  When
we did this growing up, most people had a car, a tent, and not much else.
Nowadays most campsites have multiple tents, an awning, and and lots of
junk all around.  Sometimes there are tents plus campers or trailers.
These people go to have an experience in the wild, but then try to make
the wild like home. What's the point!?

<p>After claiming a spot and setting up camp, I went back to a few of the
nearby scenic vistas.

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="9002.jpg" width=70%></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Hogback Mt Overlook</i>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>There was a large group of people here talking in a language I
couldn't even guess what it was.  It turns out they were from Kurdistan.
They were surprised that a random person knew where that was.  They had me
take a few group pictures for them, then took a picture of me with part of
the group.  I can just imagine how that will be shown back home.  <i>...
and look, here is one of the natives ...</i>

<p><table class="fixed-wide">

    </tbody>
  </table>


<h2>Sun 31 Jul</h2>

<p>It's drizzeling off and on today.  I'm slowly making my way south on
Skyline Drive, stopping at all the overlooks on the way.  The speed limit
is only 35 MPH, but I usually go 30 unless there is someone behind me.

<p>I'm at the Stony Man overlook right now, and there is actually cell
coverage here.  It's now a solid rain, so I'm checking email and updating
this web page.
