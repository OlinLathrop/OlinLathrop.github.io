<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2025)</h1>

<h2>Thu 24 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>This year I signed up for the annual Microchip Masters conference in
Phoenix Arizona, which is Mon-Thu Aug 4-7.  That means I've got 10 days to
camp just outside Phoenix and arrive at Masters early the next morning.

<p>Even though it's not really on the way, I stopped by Ari and Nicole's
house for a visit and stayed the night.  Nicole was still busy with work
when Ari and I picked up Leah and Owen from day care.  Both Ari and Nicole
work from home most of the time.  It was a nice day, and the kids had a
good time playing outside around their awsome new swingset.  That should
last until they're no longer interested in swingsets.

<p>Before it got dark, we took a group picture in the back yard:

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1306.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Nicole, Owen, Olin, Leah, Ari</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>


<h2>Fri 25 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got up and left Ari and Nicole's house by 8:00 or so.  Ari and Nicole
were going to a music festival in Newport that day, and I had to get going
to Arizona.

<p>Actually my next destination is the church in Hendersonville NC that my
great great great grandfather, the Rev John Blythe, founded and was the
first pastor of.  I finally talked to the right person at the church over
the phone as I was driving.  They do still have the photograph of John
Blythe, and apparently some additional biographical information.  We
arranged that I would show up Monday during their normal business hours to
scan and photograph what I could.

<p>There were various traffic jams, construction, and accident cleanups on
the way, but I managed to make it to the Caldonia State Park in southern
PA.  PA does a nice job with state parks and rest areas on interstate
highways.  They are one of the best around the country, while MA is the
worst for rest areas except on the expensive Mass Pike.

<p>There wasn't much daylight after I set up camp and it was drizzling, so
I didn't take any pictures.


<h2>Sat 26 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>Originally I planned to camp on the Blue Ridge Parkway near
Hendersonville on Sunday night, to be within easy reach of the church the
next morning.  I continued down I-81 and was going to get onto the Blue
Ridge Parkway after getting past Roanoke.  However, at the Virginia
"Welcome Center" (fancy rest stop, usually shortly after entering a state)
I was told that there were many closures of the Parkway in North Carolina
due to washouts from severe storms.

<p>Looking at a map revealed that it's not all that hard to get to
Hendersonville from most of the Blue Ridge as long as you get down onto
major roads.  I then decided to get on the Blue Ridge right at its start,
where Skyline Drive thru Shenendoah ends.  In other words, I'll go around
Shenendoah on the highway, then get onto the Parkway after that.

<p>At the visitor center at the start of the Parkway, the attendant nicely
marked off all the closed sections on the map he gave me.  It makes no
sense to continue there south of Virginia.  He did point out a state park
in NC that's within easy reach of Hendersonville.  Right now the plan is
to stay there tomorrow night.  Tonight I'll see how far I get and camp at
the next convenient place along the parkway.  It shouldn't be hard then to
get to that state park tomorrow.

<p>I stopped at the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area shortly past the visitor
center to check email, upload pictures from the camera, and update this
web page:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1307.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Humpback Rocks Picnic Area</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>A few minutes before taking this picture, a deer wandered thru.  This
is a really nice picnic area, but there were lots of small flys or gnats
swarming around. They didn't seem to be biting, but were annoying.  I gave
up after a little while and went to the next overlook.  I'm now typing
this at the Ravens Roost turnout and using the laptop in the passenger
seat of the car.  Nothing is buzzing around here, probably because it's
more open, sunny, and a little windy.
