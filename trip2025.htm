<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2025)</h1>

<h2>Thu 24 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>This year I signed up for the annual Microchip Masters conference in
Phoenix Arizona, which is Mon-Thu Aug 4-7.  That means I've got 10 days to
camp just outside Phoenix and arrive at Masters early the next morning.

<p>Even though it's not really on the way, I stopped by Ari and Nicole's
house for a visit and stayed the night.  Nicole was still busy with work
when Ari and I picked up Leah and Owen from day care.  Both Ari and Nicole
work from home most of the time.  It was a nice day, and the kids had a
good time playing outside around their awsome new swingset.  That should
last until they're no longer interested in swingsets.

<p>Before it got dark, we took a group picture in the back yard:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1306.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Nicole, Owen, Olin, Leah, Ari</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>


<h2>Fri 25 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got up and left Ari and Nicole's house by 8:00 or so.  Ari and Nicole
were going to a music festival in Newport that day, and I had to get going
to Arizona.

<p>Actually my next destination is the church in Hendersonville NC that my
great great great grandfather, the Rev John Blythe, founded and was the
first pastor of.  I finally talked to the right person at the church over
the phone as I was driving.  They do still have the photograph of John
Blythe, and apparently some additional biographical information.  We
arranged that I would show up Monday during their normal business hours to
scan and photograph what I could.

<p>There were various traffic jams, construction, and accident cleanups on
the way, but I managed to make it to the Caldonia State Park in southern
PA.  PA does a nice job with state parks and rest areas on interstate
highways.  They are one of the best around the country, while MA is the
worst for rest areas except on the expensive Mass Pike.

<p>There wasn't much daylight after I set up camp and it was drizzling, so
I didn't take any pictures.


<h2>Sat 26 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>Originally I planned to camp on the Blue Ridge Parkway near
Hendersonville on Sunday night, to be within easy reach of the church the
next morning.  I continued down I-81 and was going to get onto the Blue
Ridge Parkway after getting past Roanoke.  However, at the Virginia
"Welcome Center" (fancy rest stop, usually shortly after entering a state)
I was told that there were many closures of the Parkway in North Carolina
due to washouts from severe storms.

<p>Looking at a map revealed that it's not all that hard to get to
Hendersonville from most of the Blue Ridge as long as you get down onto
major roads.  I then decided to get on the Blue Ridge right at its start,
where Skyline Drive thru Shenendoah ends.  In other words, I'll go around
Shenendoah on the highway, then get onto the Parkway after that.

<p>At the visitor center at the start of the Parkway, the attendant nicely
marked off all the closed sections on the map he gave me.  It makes no
sense to continue there south of Virginia.  He did point out a state park
in NC that's within easy reach of Hendersonville.  Right now the plan is
to stay there tomorrow night.  Tonight I'll see how far I get and camp at
the next convenient place along the parkway.  It shouldn't be hard then to
get to that state park tomorrow.

<p>I stopped at the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area shortly past the visitor
center to check email, upload pictures from the camera, and update this
web page:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1307.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Humpback Rocks Picnic Area</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>A few minutes before taking this picture, a deer wandered thru.  This
is a really nice picnic area, but there were lots of small flys or gnats
swarming around. They didn't seem to be biting, but were annoying.  I gave
up after a little while and went to the next overlook.  I'm now typing
this at the Ravens Roost turnout and using the laptop in the passenger
seat of the car.  Nothing is buzzing around here, probably because it's
more open, sunny, and a little windy.

<p>Here is what the Blue Ridge Parkway looks like:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1308.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Blue Ridge Parkway, one of the more open sections.</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>It's just a 2-lane road.  Commercial vehicles are excluded.  It's meant
for the scenery, not for getting somewhere.  The speed limit is 45 MPH,
although that's too fast for many of the curvy sections, and also to see
things.  I went 30 MPH most of the time.  There are many frequent turnouts
and overlooks, so it's easy to let someone by when they're behind you.

<p>Here'a a view from one of the overlooks:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1309.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Looking northwest from an overlook on the Blue
        Ridge Parkway</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I ended up staying at the Peaks of Otter campground on the parkway.
Tomorrow I'll get to within easy reach of Hendersonville.


<h2>Sun 27 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>With all the closures, the Blue Ridge Parkway effectively ends at Peaks
of Otter. I made my way to the Lake James State Park.  It was hot, and
going swimming sounded really nice.

<p>After setting up the camp, I went to the swimming area.  There were two
free car charging stations, so I plugged into one of them.  The water was
really warm, a bit too warm, but it still felt way better than the hot
sun.  I had barely gotten into the water when they whistled and made
everyone get out.  Apparently they detected lighting somewhere.  I never
saw it, only a few threatening clouds quite a distance away.  I went back
to the car and did some Jowa things on the laptop. It was really hot in
the sun, and the car had to be where it was to plug into the charger.

<p>Eventually they let people swim again.  After that I did things on the
laptop in the car until it was fully charged, then headed back to camp.


<h2>Mon 28 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got to the First Baptist Church of Hendersonville at about 10:00. The
people there were really nice and brought me the framed picture of Rev
John Blythe, my great great great grandfather.  It seemed they were as
intrigued with me showing up as I was to see the picture.  It was much
larger than I thought, too big for the scanner even if it weren't mounted
so that it couldn't be set flat on the glass.  What they have is a modern
print made from something very old that has been lost in time, probably a
glass plate or tin-type.  This print is the closest to the original that
survives today.

<p>I photographed the print with my camera:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1313.jpg" width="67%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Rev John Blythe, around 1860</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>This is pretty much what the print looked like.  Of course the original
was black and white.  What appear to be colors are just blemishes and
aging in the original this print was made from.  Above is just very basic
processing right out of the camera.  Eventually I'll do more extensive
post-processing, with a proper black and white result.

<p>The church folks also gave me a short biographical sketch of Rev John.
They have one for all their ministers over time.  I'll eventually post
that on WikiTree.

<p>After the church, it was time to head west for real.  Leslie found
something interesting somehow related to Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad
Caverns national parks (near El Paso TX).  That's my next solid
destination.  Maybe I can get to that area by Thursday evening.

<p>The washouts affected I-40 too.  Parts were single lane in each
direction.  They're working on it, but I can see how it will be a while
before everything is normal again.

<p>I got as far as the Ceders of Lebanon State Park, a little east of
Nashville TN. The guy at the help desk in the TN welcome center said to
call as soon as possible and make reservations.  He said everything fills
up quickly in summer, even on a Monday.  I did, but there were plenty of
available spots.  TN state parks are expensive!  $50 for one night.  All
the sites had electric hookups, so at least the car got fully charged.


<h2>Tue 29 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>There was lots of traffic around Nashville, but everything else was
pretty clear. I made it to Lake Catherine State Park by a lake just a bit
past Little Rock today.  This time I didn't call ahead and reserve
anything.  There were plenty of available spots.

<p>I got here after the visitor center closed, so no way to pay.  The sign
said to grab a spot and check in by 10:00 the next morning.  I'll be long
out of here by the time the visitor center opens.  Arriving late and
leaving early may be a loophole in their system.  I'll find out tomorrow.

<p>It was really hot today, about 100&deg;F according to my car, and I
believe it.  It was nice to swim again, and it cooled down a bit after
that.  I'll try to get as far as possible tomorrow.


<h2>Wed 30 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>The visitor center was still closed when I left Lake Catherine State
Park. Oh well, not my problem anymore.  They made it impossible to pay if
you arrive late and leave early.  The site even had an electric hookup, so
I charged the car overnight.  I figure one full charge offsets about $3.50
of gasoline under current conditions.  So not only was the stay free, I
actually made about $3.50 off the state of Arkansas.

<p>The task today was to get as far as possible.  I stopped at the welcome
center on entering Texas, and found Abilene state park west of Dallas.  I
really wanted to get past Dallas today.  As usual, they told me to call
their reservation line right away. I didn't, and there were plenty of
available spaces for tents.

<p>This was a long driving day, about 490 miles.

<p>The park had a $5 entry fee with tent sites for $12 and up.  I noticed
at the entrance kiosk map that one class of sites were $12 with electric
hookup.  They were in a somewhat more open area, but not too bad.
$17/night with charging the car is a pretty good deal nowadays.

<p>Texas, like most places, have a system for paying when you arrive after
staff hours. You pick any spot not already marked as reserved, then write
down your info on a special envelope and put the money inside.  You stuff
the envelope into a secure box at the entrance kiosk.  The signs explain
all this nicely.  That sort of system is actually the norm, except in
Arkansas.


<h2>Thu 31 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got up when the birds started signing and headed west.  I wasn't sure
where this special part of the Guadalupe Mountains area was supposed to
be, but the GPS showed a minor road cutting across the green splotch north
of Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks.  That's where
I headed.

<p>West of Abilene you're really in the flat part of Texas.  I was amazed
to see the large numbers of windmills all around.  There wasn't much of a
breeze, but most of them were turning.  There must have been several
thousand visible from any one point, and this went on for probably 100
miles.  Here is one small view:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1316.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Windmills to the horizon, west of Abilene TX</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I got some more bottles to hold water and filled up the gas tank in
Carlsbad NM. That's the last town before heading off into what turned out
to be the Lincoln National Forest.  I have enough supplies now to stay
away from civilization for a few days.

<p>There is quite a network of back roads and a few points of interest in
the Lincoln National Forest.  I first tried to go to the Sitting Bull
Falls, but they were closed by the time I got there.  I did see a sign
that they would close at 16:00, but I thought that meant the visitor
center or whatever.  No, the whole road the last few miles to the falls
was closed, with a gate and even tire spikes so that you don't try to go
in the exit (which isn't otherwise blocked).  That's quite unusual for a
National Forest.

<p>There was a sign "No camping beyond this point" right before the gate,
which implies camping is permitted before that sign.  That's actually the
norm in western National Forests.  You are allowed to camp anywhere they
don't explicitly prohibit it.

<p>There was a small dirt road branching off maybe 0.1 miles previously,
so I went down that a short distance and set up my tent.  It's raining, so
I'm typing this in the car, hoping the rain will end before I have to get
into the tent.  It's 19:45 now, and it seems to be letting up a bit.  This
area is quite dry but not desert, mostly scrub and grass with a few cacti.
It looks like it never rains much for very long here.


<h2>Fri 1 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>The rain yesterday evening must have awoken the plants, because there
were lots of blooms that I didn't remember seeing yesterday.

<center><p><table class="fixed60">

      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1335.jpg" width="100%"></a>

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Desert flowers</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I waited for the road to Sitting Bull Falls to be opened, then took a
look. The falls and resulting pools really are very pretty.

<center><p><table class="fixed80">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1329.jpg" width="100%"></a>

    <tr>
      <td class="none" colspan=2><i>Sitting Bull Falls</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>In contrast, here is what the normal landscape in this area looks like:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1334.jpg" width="67%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Typical of the area around Sitting Bull Falls</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>After the falls, I headed to the Dog Canyon campground of Guadalupe
Mountains National Park.  You can only get to this area from the north,
not from the main entrance to the park.

<p>When I got to Dog Canyon, there was a ranger standing out front of the
ranger station.  He had locked up the place before going to lunch and
couldn't get back in.  The key was turning, but the door wouldn't open.  I
offered to help, and managed to open the door.  You needed to turn the key
extra hard at the end.  This was only the ranger's second day there, so he
hadn't found all the quirks yet.

<p>Two guys showed up in a truck, one to fix the internet and the other to
fix some vehicle that was dead.  I was able to get onto the internet by
using the open WiFi from my laptop, so I don't know what the problem was.
The IT guy looked busy, though.

<p>The mechanic came back quickly and said everything is working, it was a
dead battery.

<p>Just as I was about to go to the campground, we heard thunder and could
see a storm heading down the canyon.  The ranger, mechanic, and I waited
on the covered porch for the storm to pass while the IT guy was inside
doing something.  For a few minutes, 1/4 inch hail was coming down.

<p>The storm was mostly over by the time the IT guy said it couldn't be
fixed today, and that he'd have to come back another day.  I checked, and
while I could still connect to the public WiFi, it was no longer connected
to the internet.  The IT guy did <i>something</i>.

<p>There are nine campsites, and none of them were in use.  The tent sites
are all walk-in, meaning there is one parking lot, and you can only walk
to the individual sites.  I set up my tent on the one nearest to the car.
It's actually a very nice place.


<h2>Sat 2 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>There is no easy way to go west from the Dog Canyon area.  There are a
few dirt roads, but I was told there were various washouts that my car
wouldn't handle.  I had to go back east, almost to Carlsbad, then loop
back south.  That goes right past the main entrances to Carlsbad Caverns
and Guadalupe Mountain National parks.  It's 100 miles driving from Dog
Canyon to the main park entrance, even though it's only about 15 miles
over the mountains.

<p>I originally aimed for being somewhere in the Apache Sitgreaves
National Forsest tonight, but that turned out to be too far. After
stopping in El Paso and Las Cruces, I headed to the east side of the Gila
National Forest.

<p>I was going to get to the high section and find a place to set up the
tent off of a dirt road somewhere.  However, after just a few miles into
the Gila, there was a campground at the side of the road.  That was too
easy not to use.  That's where I'm typing this now.  I'll have to upload
this tomorrow as there is no cell coverage here.

<p>This campground only has a few parking areas with picnic tables.  There
are no campsite numbers and nothing even mentions paying.  This appears to
be a first-come first-serve as-is place.  That's fine with me.

<p>When I got here a rooster was crowing from the adjacent private
property.  Fortunately that stopped soon.  Then a goat slowly wandered
into camp, followed by four chickens.  I was sitting in the passenger seat
of the car with the door open, and the goat came right up to me and let me
pet it.  It then walked away after giving me a disgusted look upon
realizing it wasn't going to get a handout.  The goat and chickens
continued to wander around the campground for another half hour, then
slowly made their way back to the farmhouse next door.

<p>Tomorrow I want to go swimming, probably in Roosevelt Lake, then camp
within easy reach of the Masters conference the next morning.  That's
probably around 400 miles.  We'll see how it goes.


<h2>Sun 3 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>The rooster crowed before it even started to get light.  I got up once
it did get light since this is going to be a long day.  The goats and
chickens did another tour around the campground.  The rooster even hopped
up on my picnic table and crowed a few times, but hopped down before I
could get the camera out.  The goat was more cooperative:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Goat wandering thru campground, Gila National Forest</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>It was a long drive to Roosevelt Lake where I went swimming.  I
deliberately left my T-shirt on so that it would get wet and keep me cool
a while afterwards.  It was 107&deg;F along Roosevelt Lake shortly after
leaving the swimming area.

<p>The places to camp near Phoenix are all hot, so I headed up to Mt Ord
as far as allowed.  That's where I'm writing this now.  It's only 89&deg;F
here with a breeze, which is not bad since it's so dry.

<p>The plan was to stay here and head for a camp close to Phoenix just in
time to set up the tent before it gets dark.  I checked the Masters
agenda, and found that things don't start until 12:00.  That means I don't
need to be as close to Phoenix in the morning as I thought.  There would
even be time to get from here (Mt Ord) to Masters well before 12:00.

<p>This is going to be the last entry here for a while.  Masters runs thru
noon on Thursday.  You probably won't here much from me until then.



<h2>Mon 4 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>Since I don't need to be at Masters until 12:00, I stayed the night on
Mt Ord. While coming down the twisty dirt road from Mt Ord, there were
some nice views of the Mazatzal range to the north:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">

      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1341.jpg" width="100%"></a>

    </tbody>
  </table></center>


<h2>Tue 5 Aug - Wed 6 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>At the Masters conference.


<h2>Thu 7 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>Masters ended today at noon.  This year's conference was better than it
had been the last few times I went.  I learned some interesting and useful
things.

<p>It was really hot, even for Phoenix norms.  At around 13:00 my car
indicated 117&deg;F while driving down the Pima Expressway on the east
side of Phoenix.

<p>My next destination is Great Divide in CO.  My great grandfather
homesteaded there.  It's a ghost town now, but apparently the old post
office is still standing.  I got a little past Heber AZ today.  That's the
last location along the route to Great Divide where there are still a few
trees.

<p>I knew Great Divide was somewhere in the northwest corner of CO,
northwest of Craig, but not exactly where.  It was harder than I thought
to find the location since it's not on most maps anymore.  One web site
gave lat/lon coordinates, but that was contradicted by other web sites.
After some digging, I think it's where Moffatt County roads #7 and #5
intersect.  Google Earth shows some buildings there, so it's at least
plausible.  I won't know for sure until I get there.


<h2>Fri 8 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>Today was a long travel day.  The original plan was to get close enough
to Great Divide to be within easy reach the next morning.  Then I noticed
Dinosour National Monument was near there, so headed for that.

<p>I got to the Dinosour National Monument visitor center after it closed,
but there was a map posted outside.  Apparently there are two entrances. I
was at the one in CO, with the other west in UT.  It looked like the
entrance road here in CO has a strip of national monument on either side.
They probably don't allow wild camping.  However, I could get to BLM land
by taking one of the minor dirt roads that crossed the national monument
entrance road.  After only &frac14; mile, you're outside the monument.  I
set up camp a little past that.  The only sign of civilization was the
dirt road and lots of dried cow pies all over the place.

<h2>Sat 9 Aug 2025</h2>

<p>Here is my campsite at dawn.  It was 62&deg;F this morning, but I'm
sure that won't last long after the sun comes up.

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1344.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Camp at dawn, on BLM land off of Dinosour
      National Monument east entrance road</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I checked email, updated this web page, and a few other things in the
visitor center parking lot waiting for it to open.  It turns out all the
dinosaur stuff is in the west section in UT.  The CO part, where I was,
supposedly has a bunch of scenic vistas.  I was hoping to get to Great
Divide today, and didn't want to go the opposite direction into UT.
Instead, I went to the end of the scenic drive and back, stopping at all
the vista points on the way out.

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1347.jpg" width="100%"></a>

    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Views from the Dinosaur National Monument scenic
      road in Colorado</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>After coming back from the scenic road, I needed gas.  There were two
gas stations in the nearby town of Dinosaur.  Gas is really expensive
here, $3.50/gallon.

<p>I headed to where I thought Great Divide used to be, which included
about 30 miles on county dirt roads.  As soon as I got there, I recognized
the shell of the old post office from pictures I'd seen of my great
grandfather and great uncle Ron when he was just a boy.

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1359.jpg" width="100%"></a>

      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1369.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Remains of the post office and general store in
      Great Divide, Colorado</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I haven't heard back from the distant cousin in Idaho who is also
decended from Merritt Adams and Betsy, so the next destination is home.

<p>It was too late to get far, so I headed for the national forest north
of Craig. I'll figure out the rest tomorrow.
