<h1>Show and Tell:<br>
  What I did on my summer vacation (2025)</h1>

<h2>Thu 24 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>This year I signed up for the annual Microchip Masters conference in
Phoenix Arizona, which is Mon-Thu Aug 4-7.  That means I've got 10 days to
camp just outside Phoenix and arrive at Masters early the next morning.

<p>Even though it's not really on the way, I stopped by Ari and Nicole's
house for a visit and stayed the night.  Nicole was still busy with work
when Ari and I picked up Leah and Owen from day care.  Both Ari and Nicole
work from home most of the time.  It was a nice day, and the kids had a
good time playing outside around their awsome new swingset.  That should
last until they're no longer interested in swingsets.

<p>Before it got dark, we took a group picture in the back yard:

      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1306.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Nicole, Owen, Olin, Leah, Ari</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>


<h2>Fri 25 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got up and left Ari and Nicole's house by 8:00 or so.  Ari and Nicole
were going to a music festival in Newport that day, and I had to get going
to Arizona.

<p>Actually my next destination is the church in Hendersonville NC that my
great great great grandfather, the Rev John Blythe, founded and was the
first pastor of.  I finally talked to the right person at the church over
the phone as I was driving.  They do still have the photograph of John
Blythe, and apparently some additional biographical information.  We
arranged that I would show up Monday during their normal business hours to
scan and photograph what I could.

<p>There were various traffic jams, construction, and accident cleanups on
the way, but I managed to make it to the Caldonia State Park in southern
PA.  PA does a nice job with state parks and rest areas on interstate
highways.  They are one of the best around the country, while MA is the
worst for rest areas except on the expensive Mass Pike.

<p>There wasn't much daylight after I set up camp and it was drizzling, so
I didn't take any pictures.


<h2>Sat 26 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>Originally I planned to camp on the Blue Ridge Parkway near
Hendersonville on Sunday night, to be within easy reach of the church the
next morning.  I continued down I-81 and was going to get onto the Blue
Ridge Parkway after getting past Roanoke.  However, at the Virginia
"Welcome Center" (fancy rest stop, usually shortly after entering a state)
I was told that there were many closures of the Parkway in North Carolina
due to washouts from severe storms.

<p>Looking at a map revealed that it's not all that hard to get to
Hendersonville from most of the Blue Ridge as long as you get down onto
major roads.  I then decided to get on the Blue Ridge right at its start,
where Skyline Drive thru Shenendoah ends.  In other words, I'll go around
Shenendoah on the highway, then get onto the Parkway after that.

<p>At the visitor center at the start of the Parkway, the attendant nicely
marked off all the closed sections on the map he gave me.  It makes no
sense to continue there south of Virginia.  He did point out a state park
in NC that's within easy reach of Hendersonville.  Right now the plan is
to stay there tomorrow night.  Tonight I'll see how far I get and camp at
the next convenient place along the parkway.  It shouldn't be hard then to
get to that state park tomorrow.

<p>I stopped at the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area shortly past the visitor
center to check email, upload pictures from the camera, and update this
web page:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1307.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Humpback Rocks Picnic Area</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>A few minutes before taking this picture, a deer wandered thru.  This
is a really nice picnic area, but there were lots of small flys or gnats
swarming around. They didn't seem to be biting, but were annoying.  I gave
up after a little while and went to the next overlook.  I'm now typing
this at the Ravens Roost turnout and using the laptop in the passenger
seat of the car.  Nothing is buzzing around here, probably because it's
more open, sunny, and a little windy.

<p>Here is what the Blue Ridge Parkway looks like:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1308.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Blue Ridge Parkway, one of the more open sections.</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>It's just a 2-lane road.  Commercial vehicles are excluded.  It's meant
for the scenery, not for getting somewhere.  The speed limit is 45 MPH,
although that's too fast for many of the curvy sections, and also to see
things.  I went 30 MPH most of the time.  There are many frequent turnouts
and overlooks, so it's easy to let someone by when they're behind you.

<p>Here'a a view from one of the overlooks:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1309.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Looking northwest from an overlook on the Blue
        Ridge Parkway</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>I ended up staying at the Peaks of Otter campground on the parkway.
Tomorrow I'll get to within easy reach of Hendersonville.


<h2>Sun 27 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>With all the closures, the Blue Ridge Parkway effectively ends at Peaks
of Otter. I made my way to the Lake James State Park.  It was hot, and
going swimming sounded really nice.

<p>After setting up the camp, I went to the swimming area.  There were two
free car charging stations, so I plugged into one of them.  The water was
really warm, a bit too warm, but it still felt way better than the hot
sun.  I had barely gotten into the water when they whistled and made
everyone get out.  Apparently they detected lighting somewhere.  I never
saw it, only a few threatening clouds quite a distance away.  I went back
to the car and did some Jowa things on the laptop. It was really hot in
the sun, and the car had to be where it was to plug into the charger.

<p>Eventually they let people swim again.  After that I did things on the
laptop in the car until it was fully charged, then headed back to camp.


<h2>Mon 28 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got to the First Baptist Church of Hendersonville at about 10:00. The
people there were really nice and brought me the framed picture of Rev
John Blythe, my great great great grandfather.  It seemed they were as
intrigued with me showing up as I was to see the picture.  It was much
larger than I thought, too big for the scanner even if it weren't mounted
so that it couldn't be set flat on the glass.  What they have is a modern
print made from something very old that has been lost in time, probably a
glass plate or tin-type.  This print is the closest to the original that
survives today.

<p>I photographed the print with my camera:

<center><p><table class="fixed60">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><img src="d103-1313.jpg" width="100%"></a>
    <tr>
      <td class="none"><i>Rev John Blythe, around 1860</i>
    </tbody>
  </table></center>

<p>This is pretty much what the print looked like.  Of course the original
was black and white.  What appear to be colors are just blemishes and
aging in the original this print was made from.  Above is just very basic
processing right out of the camera.  Eventually I'll do more extensive
post-processing, with a proper black and white result.

<p>The church folks also gave me a short biographical sketch of Rev John.
They have one for all their ministers over time.  I'll eventually post
that on WikiTree.

<p>After the church, it was time to head west for real.  Leslie found
something interesting somehow related to Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad
Caverns national parks (near El Paso TX).  That's my next solid
destination.  Maybe I can get to that area by Thursday evening.

<p>The washouts affected I-40 too.  Parts were single lane in each
direction.  They're working on it, but I can see how it will be a while
before everything is normal again.

<p>I got as far as the Ceders of Lebanon State Park, a little east of
Nashville TN. They guy at the help desk in the TN welcome center said to
call as soon as possible and make reservations.  He said everything fills
up quickly in summer, even on a Monday.  I did, but there were plenty of
available spots.  TN state parks are expensive!  $50 for one night.  All
the sites had electric hookups, so at least the car got fully charged.


<h2>Tue 29 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>There was lots of traffic around Nashville, but everything else was
pretty clear. I made it to Lake Catherine State Park by a lake just a bit
past Little Rock today.  This time I didn't call ahead and reserve
anything.  There were plenty of available spots.

<p>I got here after the visitor center closed, so no way to pay.  The sign
said to grab a spot and check in by 10:00 the next morning.  I'll be long
out of here by the time the visitor center opens.  Arriving late and
leaving early may be a loophole in their system.  I'll find out tomorrow.

<p>It was really hot today, about 100&deg;F according to my car, and I
believe it.  It was nice to swim again, and it cooled down a bit after
that.  I'll try to get as far as possible tomorrow.


<h2>Wed 30 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>The visitor center was still closed when I left Lake Catherine State
Park. Oh well, not my problem anymore.  They made it impossible to pay if
you arrive late and leave early.  The site even had an electric hookup, so
I charged the car overnight.  I figure one full charge offsets about $3.50
of gasoline under current conditions.  So not only was the stay free, I
actually made about $3.50 off the state of Arkansas.

<p>The task today was to get as far as possible.  I stopped at the welcome
center on entering Texas, and found Abilene state park west of Dallas.  I
really wanted to get past Dallas today.  As usual, they told me to call
their reservation line right away. I didn't, and there were plenty of
available spaces for tents.

<p>This was a long driving day, about 490 miles.

<p>The park had a $5 entry fee with tent sites for $12 and up.  I noticed
at the entrance kiosk map that one class of sites were $12 with electric
hookup.  They were in a somewhat more open area, but not too bad.
$17/night with charging the car is a pretty good deal nowadays.

<p>Texas, like most places, have a system for paying when you arrive after
staff hours. You pick any spot not already marked as reserved, then write
down your info on a special envelope and put the money inside.  You stuff
the envelope into a secure box at the entrance kiosk.  The signs explain
all this nicely.  That sort of system is actually the norm, except in
Arkansas.


<h2>Thu 31 Jul 2025</h2>

<p>I got up when the birds started signing and headed west.  I wasn't sure
where this special part of the Guadalupe Mountains area was supposed to
be, but the GPS showed a minor road cutting across the green splotch north
of Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks.  That's where
I headed.

<p>I got some more bottles to hold water and filled up the gas tank in
Carlsbad NM. That's the last town before heading off into what turned out
to be the Lincoln National Forest.  I have enough supplies to stay away
from civilization for a few days if need be.

<p>There is quite a network of back roads and a few points of interest in
the Lincoln National Forest.  I first tried to go to the Sitting Bull
Falls, but they were closed by the time I got there.  I did see a sign
that they would close at 16:00, but I thought that meant the visitor
center or whatever.  No, the whole road the last few miles to the falls
was closed, with a gate and even tire spikes so that you don't try to go
in the exit (which isn't otherwise blocked).  That's quite unusual for a
National Forest.

<p>There was a sign "No camping beyond this point" right before the gate,
which implies camping is permitted before that sign.  That's actually the
norm in western National Forests.  You are allowed to camp anywhere they
don't explicitly prohibit it.

<p>There was a small dirt road branching off maybe 0.1 miles previously,
so I went down that a short distance and set up my tent.  It's raining
here now, so I'm typing this in the car, hoping the rain will end before I
have to get into the tent.  It's 19:45 now, and seems to be letting up a
bit.  This area is quite dry but not desert, mostly scrub and grass with a
few cacti.  It doesn't look like it ever rains much for very long here.
